# Project Name

This repository contains the code and resources for the Wireless-Node-Architecture of multiple autonomous operant conditioning devices. Please note that this project is currently a work in progress, and code is being actively added and refined.


## Thesis Proposal

The purpose of this project is to:
1. Implementing live tracking of cichlids using YOLOv5 to develop Raspberry-Pi-based Automated Conditional Training Apparatus for Cognition Testing in Fishes and testing the apparatus in Field conditions
2. Development of a Client-server architecture of multiple Raspberry Pis to improve existing data consolidation and management pipelines in automated cognition testing.
  

For a more detailed overview of the project's purpose, goals, and methodology, you can refer to the complete **Thesis Proposal** document. The proposal outlines the project's background, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes in depth.

## Dependencies

To run this project on your Raspberry Pi, you'll need the following dependencies:
